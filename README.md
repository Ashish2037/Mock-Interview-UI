# Virtual Interviewer Application

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Virtual Interviewer Application. The application is designed to help users practice and improve their interview skills in a virtual environment.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition:** The application uses the SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken words into text.
- **Interview Simulation:** Users can simulate a virtual interview with the application, receiving questions and providing spoken answers.
- **Head Pose Analysis:** The application analyzes the user's head pose during the interview to provide feedback on their posture.
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection, including the detection of people and mobile phones.
- **Facial Landmark Detection:** Integrates MediaPipe for facial landmark detection to analyze facial expressions and movements.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts text to speech using the gTTS library for providing instructions and feedback during the interview.
